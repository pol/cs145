    %h3 Sam &amp; Sara
    %p We are Sam and Sara Wiley, and as you have probably already deduced: we are fanatical about books. And perhaps the game of Rock Paper Scissors as well... We grew up in the small Romanian town of Bacaslova, a bit to the south and east of Bucharest. We both moved to the United States in 2000 to follow our dream of opening a Roshambo themed book store.

    %p It began with a game.  We were in a little shop and asked for their game section and were saddened to find only two or three books about games.  We looked at each other thinking the same thing: This is clearly something the world needs.  A bookshop about games, specifically the most important game: rock paper scissors.  It is the game from which all games are wrought. The shop is like the game, the book shop with a single simple idea from which all bookshops are wrought.

    %h3 The book that began the journey...
    %p We would tell you the title, but just as the contents, it is shrouded in mystery. We found this book abandoned in a seaside cave with no evidence from where it came. It was then our fascination with books began-- to discover the mysterious origins of the tome... to date we have not.
